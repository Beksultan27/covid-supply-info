# Covid-19 supply app

This project contains a simple list of users and an admin application (`localhost:3000/admin`) with basic authentication.

## Technology Stack

Keystone, Graphql e.t.c.

We have to be quick, so try using as much abstractions as possible.

## Running the Project.

To run this project first install dependencies with `yarn`.

After that run `yarn run dev`

Once running, the Keystone Admin UI is reachable via `localhost:3000/admin`.

## Next steps

This example has no front-end application but you can build your own using the GraphQL API (`http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql`).

`index.js` contains everything for now, but we need a separate file called `schema.js` where our database schema will be located.

Keystone generates the admin UI automatically.

## Good luck!
